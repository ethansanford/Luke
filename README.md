# Burls Sports

Burls Sports is an online vintage baseball card company. We contacted the owner, Justin Burleson, for permission to use his company to create a website for our project. Not only did he give us permission to create the websitte, he also gave us a multittude of images and descriptions for us to use. 

The website was created by Ethan Sanford and Luke Wood to allow the customers of Burls Sports to learn about what we do as a company and allow them to buy baseball cards. 

The Website

  Our website looks great and is very easy to navigate on almost all devices, since we knew that it is important for a business to be accessible cross-platform. The website has multiple descriptions of all the different services we have. there is also a page that shows a sample of some baseball cards that we sell. 
  
  We have the company's logo neatly placed on each page for easy navigation and also to show who we are as a company. On our footer we have included basic and essential contact information to make contacting Burls Sports very easy. 
  
  We have used a basic sans-serif font to assist in continuity and readibility. We choses our color scheme of shades of blue and orange to match and coordinate with our logo. We tried to keep our text mostly black on white backgrounds for ease of reading. 
  
Thank you for taking the time to explore our website, it is greatly appreicated!
